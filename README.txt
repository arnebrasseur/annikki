Annikki is a logbook for your Anki, the spaced repetition software.

Annikki consists of two parts : one part is the website Annikki.org where you can find how well you and others are doing.

A second part is the Annikki plugin for Anki. This little plugin will submit all cards you study to Annikki.

Both parts are still in early development.
